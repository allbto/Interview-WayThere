# WayThere
WayThere is a simple yet beautiful weather iOS app.       
This is an interview test project.

In this repo you will find 2 folders `ios` and `web` each of them containing a README.md for further instructions.

* [ios/](ios/) contains all the Swift source code and the Xcode project for **WayThere**
* [web/](web/) is a *little* bonus that I made before getting the instructions (I've just been told it was a Weather App).

Following the instructions and my own methods of work, I've been doing all my devs in a branch called `dev`, I also used issues and milestones to organize my progression.
